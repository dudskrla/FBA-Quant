# ðŸ“‚ Financial Engineering

### Introduction
Financial engineering involves the application of mathematical, statistical, and stochastic methodologies and models to determine the rational pricing of financial products. It encompasses various techniques and approaches, including widely used methods such as the Binomial tree, Black-Scholes formula, Merton's model, and the Margrabe formula. By utilizing these tools, we can accurately assess the fair value of exotic options, bonds, and credit, mortgage-backed securities. These methods enhance our understanding of the financial markets and enable us to interpret and analyze the complex dynamics of different financial instruments. Financial engineering plays a crucial role in developing quantitative skills and the necessary expertise to navigate the intricacies of the financial industry.
