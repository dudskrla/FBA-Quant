# ðŸ“‚ Asset Pricing

### Introduction

The Asset Pricing course focuses on traditional financial methodologies and statistical interpretations to calculate expected returns for specific assets. The course is divided into two primary segments.

In the first half of the course, spanning eight weeks, we study accounting methods and how to get fundamental data from public data sources like SEC EDGAR. By conducting a hands-on valuation of Tesla Inc., we are going to hone our skills in interpreting financial statements and fundamental data.
In the second half, we shift our focus to the cost of capital. We will review the classical asset pricing theory known as CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model) and extend our understanding to more complex concepts such as the Consumption CAPM and the multi-factor model.

In the final phase of the course, we merge our understanding of factor models and accounting methods to calculate the appropriate expected return for a specific security issued by a company. This comprehensive approach equips participants with practical skills for realistic financial analysis scenarios.
