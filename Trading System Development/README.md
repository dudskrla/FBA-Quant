# ðŸ“‚ Trading System Development

### Introduction

Fancy machine learning algorithms are everywhere these days. After learning some time series analysis or some ML techniques, some might think, "Hey, I can make some cash out of it by predicting the stock market!" It's harder than it looks. It goes without saying that trading algorithms are not generalizable due to overfitting. But also more important (but often neglected) factor is about having a reliable trading system where you can fetch the data, wrangle with it, and actually execute your orders in an efficient manner.

Throughout this course, you are going to delve into one of the most renowned trading system, InteractiveBrokers. Primary goal is to build your own efficient/reliable trading tool on top of the TWS workstation. Note that this course requires less financial background, but more of a CS background.
