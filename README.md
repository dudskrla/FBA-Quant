### ðŸ“‚ **Systematic Market Making**

Our objective is to learn the models for algorithmic trading in contexts such as executing large orders, market making, targeting VWAP and other schedules, trading pairs or collections of assets, and executing in dark pools. Before we dive into these models, we will cover foundations in reinforcement learning - Markov decision processes, Bellman equations, and dynamic programming, and combine these into continuous-time stochastic calculus to solve stochastic optimal control problems in algorithmic trading models.

### ðŸ“‚ **Trading System Development**

Throughout this course, you are going to delve into one of the most renowned trading system, InteractiveBrokers. Primary goal is to build your own efficient/reliable trading tool on top of the TWS workstation. Note that this course requires less financial background, but more of a CS background.
