# ðŸ“‚ Systematic Market Making

### Introduction

Our objective is to learn the models for algorithmic trading in contexts such as executing large orders, market making, targeting VWAP and other schedules, trading pairs or collections of assets, and executing in dark pools. Before we dive into these models, we will cover foundations in reinforcement learning - Markov decision processes, Bellman equations, and dynamic programming, and combine these into continuous-time stochastic calculus to solve stochastic optimal control problems in algorithmic trading models.
