# ðŸ“‚ Systematic Market Making

### Introduction

Our objective is to learn the models for algorithmic trading in contexts such as executing large orders, market making, targeting VWAP and other schedules, trading pairs or collections of assets, and executing in dark pools. Before we dive into these models, we will cover foundations in reinforcement learning - Markov decision processes, Bellman equations, and dynamic programming, and combine these into continuous-time stochastic calculus to solve stochastic optimal control problems in algorithmic trading models.

[Prerequisites]

- Undergraduate-level background in Multivariate Analysis, Linear Algebra, Probability, and Optimization
- Background in Python programming, data structures/algorithms, and fluency with NumPy
- Basic familiarity with Algorithmic Trading, but we will do an overview of the requisite Finance/Economics No background required in MDP, DP, RL (we will cover from scratch)
